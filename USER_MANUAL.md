# User Manual

The sections below describe CAR's basic and advanced features on multiple clients.

To invoke CAR, users just need to download the released CAR client software from (https://github.com/neurogeom/CAR/releases/tag/v1.2.0). We have provided two test accounts and test image data in the CAR-WS user manual. Information including server IP and port details has been integrated directly into the CAR client software.
