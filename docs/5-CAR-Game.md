# CAR-Game

CAR-Game is a separate component of the CAR ecosystem, but it also uses CAR Server for task distribution and scheduling. It is designed to enable the general public understand and explore neuronal data, but it is not a major part of the work "Collaborative Augmented Reconstruction for Scaled Production of 3D Neuron Morphology in Mouse and Human Brains" and is still an unpublished work. The user manual of CAR-Game is to be developed.
