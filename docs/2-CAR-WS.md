# CAR-WS


CAR-WS is built upon the foundation of the Vaa3D system, incorporating a cloud server and enabling collaborative capabilities. It also incorporates several features from [Vaa3D](http://www.vaa3d.org/), please refers the [User Manual](https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/UserManual.wiki) for details.


## Installation

The workstation client and the VR client share the same software. For Windows system user, please download and unzip the releases and click on `vaa3d_CAR.exe` to run the software. The whole installation will cost 1-2 minutes. For others system user, please build CAR-VR-WS from scratch.

<details>
<summary>Build CAR-WS-VR from scratch</summary>

CAR-WS and CAR-VR clients share the same codebase based on Qt 4.7.3. You can refer to the following tutorials to compile.

- [On Linux](https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/Build-Vaa3D-on-Linux): Build CAR-VR-WS with MSVC and QMake.
- [On Windows](https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/Build-Vaa3D-on-Windows-(QMake)): Build CAR-VR-WS with LLVM and QMake.

## Configuration and authorization

> [!TIP]
>
> Suitable data should consist of image files, such as those in TIFF format. For demonstration purposes, [test data](../assets/demo_image_data) is available for use.
> 
> If you are using our test server, we have provided two available test users. The usernames and passwords are as follows:
> 
> - Username: `testuser`, password: `123456`
> - Username: `testuser02`, password: `123456`
> 
> Additionally, we have already created two annotation files (two collaboration rooms), don't worry, you will encounter them in the upcoming tutorial.
> - A human brain neuron: `00029_P001_T01-S001_MFG_R0460_WY-20220415_GYC_03`.
> - A mouse brain neuron: `18454-00019`.

</details>

1. Click `File` - `Open TeraFly Image(3-5D)` and choose an terafly format image.
2. Click `Collaborate` - `Load Reconstruction From Server` and then choose an annotation file (usually containing soma coordinates).
3. Choose any of them and click on `LoadAno` to enter collaboration mode.
4. A message window will pop up stating "Connect success! Ready to start collaborating". Click `OK` you can collaborate with others. Users can collaborateÂ in one room each other by choose the same annotation file.


### Basic operations in manually annotation in CAR

During the annotation process, you can understand the current resolution of the image by viewing the "Resolution" option on the panel while toggling the resolution with a double-click of the mouse or scrolling the mouse wheel upwards.

After annotating the neural signal in the current image, you can click the left and right arrows for x/y/z under "Volume Of Interest (VOI)'s coordinates" to translate the image block along the X/Y/Z directions in the coordinate system (the colors of the arrows correspond to the colors of the coordinate system), allowing continued annotation of this neuron in a new image block.

In the annotation process, the "Contrast" option is typically used to adjust the contrast between the signal and the background, aiding in identifying weak signals.

If other signals interfere significantly with this neuron signal, you can reduce interference by adjusting the scroll bars for X-cut / Y-cut / Z-cut under the "Volume Cut" option to hide portions of the image block along the X/Y/Z directions in the coordinate system.

This makes it easier to judge the correct direction of the signal. Additionally, the scroll bars for X/Y/Z directions under the "Surface Cut" option can hide or display annotated line segments in the corresponding directions, also helping to reduce interference. 

When encountering situations where the neuron signal is intertwined with other signals and is difficult to determine, you can adjust the "Z-thick" option to stretch along the Z-axis direction. If using the above options still makes it difficult to judge the correct direction of the neuron

During the annotation process, simply move the cursor to the desired location and press the `Q` key to quickly place a marker there.

Several shortcuts are provided to facilitate annotation:

| Shortcut          | Action                                                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Q`               | Define a marker.                                                      |
| `S`               | Toggle show/hide the line segment                                     |
| `Alt`-`B`         | **B**Boxes Mode: Draw curves using serial bounding boxes.             |
| `Alt`-`C`         | **C**onnection Mode: Connect multiple neuron segments.                |
| `Alt`-`D`         | **D**eleting Mode: Delete multiple neuron segments.                   |
| `Alt`-`S`         | **S**plitting/breaking Mode: Split or break multiple neuron segments. |
| `Alt`-`T`         | **T**yping Mode: Change types for multiple neuron segments.           |
| `Shift`-`Alt`-`T` | Color Setting Mode: Set the color of neuron segments.                 |

#### Version control based on snapshots

Select the file, right-click, and choose `Create Snapshot` from the context menu.Users can create snapshots to save the current annotation results at a specific moment. Each snapshot will be recorded and stored for future reference.


#### Version control based on timestamps

1. Select the file, right-click, and choose `Version Control` from the context menu.
2. A new window will appear, allowing the user to specify any timestamp for exporting or reverting to the reconstructed morphology using the `Export` and `Revert` buttons. This feature enables tracing back to historical reconstruction data at any desired moment.
3. Select `Export`, and a new window will appear. In this window, users can view specific features of the exported morphology, including Swc Node Number, and choose the save path for the exported file.


#### Version rollback

Before selecting `Revert`, users will be prompted to export a backup. Only after exporting the backup can they proceed with the revert process. Upon selecting `Revert`, a new window will appear where users can revert the morphology to the desired time-stamp.
